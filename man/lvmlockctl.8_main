.SH USAGE
.
.TP
.B --info
This collects and displays lock state from lvmlockd.  The display is
primitive, incomplete and may change in future versions.  To print the raw
info lines from lvmlockd, combine this option with --dump|-d.
Each VG lockspace may include lines with prefixes:
"VG" for volume group info, "LS" for lockspace info, "PR" for persistent
reservation fencing info, "LK" for lock info, "LW" for waiting lock info.
.
.TP
.B --dump
This collects the circular log buffer of debug statements from lvmlockd
and prints it.
.
.TP
.B --kill
This is run by sanlock when it loses access to the storage holding leases
for a VG.  It runs the command specified in lvm.conf
lvmlockctl_kill_command to deactivate LVs in the VG.  If the specified
command is successful, locks will be dropped for the VG in lvmlockd
(the equivalent of \fBlvmlockctl --drop\fP will be run.)  If no command
is specified, or the command fails, then the user must intervene
to forcefully deactivate LVs in the VG, and if successful, run
\fBlvmlockctl --drop\fP.  For more, see
.BR lvmlockd (8).
.
.TP
.B --drop
This should only be run after a VG has been successfully deactivated
following an lvmlockctl --kill command.  It clears the stale lockspace
from lvmlockd.  When lvmlockctl_kill_command is used, the --kill
command may run drop automatically.  For more, see
.BR lvmlockd (8).
.
.TP
.B --gl-enable
This enables the global lock in a sanlock VG.  This is necessary if the VG
that previously held the global lock is removed.  For more, see
.BR lvmlockd (8).
.
.TP
.B --gl-disable
This disables the global lock in a sanlock VG.  This is necessary if the
global lock has mistakenly been enabled in more than one VG.  The global
lock should be disabled in all but one sanlock VG.  For more, see
.BR lvmlockd (8).
.
.TP
.B --stop-lockspaces
This tells lvmlockd to stop all lockspaces.  It can be useful to stop
lockspaces for VGs that the \fBvgchange --lock-stop\fP command can no longer
see, or to stop the dlm global lockspace which is not directly stopped by
the vgchange command.  The wait and force options can be used with this
command.
